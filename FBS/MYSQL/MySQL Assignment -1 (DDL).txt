    end_date DATE,
    job_id INT,
    department_id INT
);

5.Write an SQL statement to alter a table named countries to make sure that no

-> ALTER TABLE countries
ADD PRIMARY KEY (country_id);

6.Write an SQL statement to create a table named jobs including columns job_id,

-> CREATE TABLE jobs (
    job_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    job_title VARCHAR(50) DEFAULT '',
    min_salary INT DEFAULT 8000,
    max_salary INT DEFAULT NULL
);

7.Create a Department table with following structure

    DEPARTMENT_NAME VARCHAR(30) NOT NULL DEFAULT NULL,
    MANAGER_ID DECIMAL(6,0) NOT NULL DEFAULT 0,
    LOCATION_ID DECIMAL(4,0) DEFAULT NULL,

    email         VARCHAR(100),
    phone_number  VARCHAR(20),
    hire_date     DATE,
    job_id        INT,
    salary        DECIMAL(10,2),
    commission    DECIMAL(5,2),
    manager_id    DECIMAL(6,0),
    department_id DECIMAL(4,0),

    CONSTRAINT fk_dept_mgr 
    FOREIGN KEY (department_id, manager_id) 
    REFERENCES Department(department_id, manager_id)
);
